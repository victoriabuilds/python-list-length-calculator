# List Length Python Script

This is a simple Python script I wrote to practice working with lists and the `len()` function.

### What does the script do?
- It initializes a list with a bunch of numbers.
- Then, it calculates and prints the length of the list (the number of items in it).

### How to use it
1. Copy the Python code into a `.py` file (for example, `list_length.py`).
2. Run the script, and it will print out the length of the list.

### Code Example:
```python
# Initialize the list
l = [13, 99, 6, 76, 11, 83, 27, 84, 28, 67, 66, 22, 96, 46, 63, 21, 65,]()
